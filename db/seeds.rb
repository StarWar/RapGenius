The single was released with a music video directed by Dave Meyers and The Little Homies. It features religious imagery mixed with urban life, such as Kendrick in priest’s robes and a moving re-enactment of Leonardo Da Vinci’s painting The Last Supper—a juxtaposition with the concept of humility in the hook.\r\n\r\nOn a religious note, the song could also be a reference to the verse James 4:7.\r\n\r\nSo humble yourselves before God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.\"\r\n\r\n—Thus linking to April 7th.\r\n\r\nThe beat was provided by Mike WiLL Made-It which features a deep piano riff and a banging 808 bass line. This style of production is a departure from the sound of Kendrick’s previous jazz-influenced project, To Pimp a Butterfly. It seems to reference the character Deebo’s theme song from the popular comedy movie Friday (1995). Kendrick is also shown riding through the neighborhood on a bicycle in the music video, similar to Deebo in Friday.\r\n\r\n“HUMBLE.” was released a week after the first promotional single, “The Heart Part 4,” and features on Lamar’s new album “DAMN.,” which was released on April 14th.\r\n\r\nThe song debuted at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 dated 04.22.17, making it not only the highest charting song for Kendrick but also one of the highest debuting hip-hop singles since “Love the Way You Lie” by Eminem. The song later hit #1 on the chart dated 05.06.17 making it Lamar’s first #1 song as the lead artist and second #1 song overall on the chart."}
